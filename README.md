# Authnet

Authnet is a graph based auth service, which support graph's features but optimize for performance.

## Comparison

| Aspect | Tranditional(SQL) | Graph
| :------ | :--: | :-----------: 
| Data Model | Relational tables (e.g., users, roles, permissions) | Graph nodes and edges (e.g., users, roles, permissions as nodes, relationships as edges) 
| Query Complexity | Joins and complex queries for relational data | Traversal queries for graph relationships
| Relationship Handling | Foreign keys and JOINs | Relationships defined by edges in the graph
| Scalability | May face scalability challenges with complex joins and large datasets | Can scale more easily for complex relationships and queries
| Control | Depends on schema(e.g., RBAC, PBA) | Fine grained

| Aspect | vertex based | edge based
| :------ | :--: | :-----------: 
| Data Model | Store both vertex and edge | Only store edge
| Usage | Can store extra information on vertex | Only care about auth
| Storage | V + E | E

| Aspect | Directional | Bidirectional
| :------ | :--: | :-----------: 
| Data Model | Directional edge | Two graphs to store distinct direction
| Usage | Hard to execute reverse query(e.g., who has auth to object) | Can do reverse query
| Storage | E | 2E

## Features

- [x] Get all edges
- [x] Create edge
- [x] Delete edge

- [x] Get all subject relations
- [x] Get tree

## Relation

The `Relation` struct represents a relationship like edge in DAG between objects and subjects. It is defined as follows:

```go
// This means: Subject has a relation on Object
type Relation struct {
    ObjectNamespace  string
    ObjectName       string 
    ObjectRelation         string 
    SubjectNamespace string 
    SubjectName      string 
    SubjectRelation  string 
}
```

## How to use

1. Run postgres on docker(without docker, see ./docker-compose.yaml to get config)

    ```bash
    docker compose up -d postgres
    ```

2. Run the main server

    ```bash
    go run .
    ```

## Abbreviation

- Namespace -> Ns
- Relation -> Rel
- Object -> Obj
- Subject -> Sbj
- Condition -> Cond
- Authority -> Auth

## Something...
### Why only store edges?
Store only edges can reduce the storage space usage, our app only concern about
who has access to the other instead of the vertex's infomation. So we can focus
on access management to reduce the other requirement
